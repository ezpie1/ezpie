# Installation : 

```bash
pip install pygame
```
#### Pygame is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python. It uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer library and several other popular libraries to abstract the most common functions, making writing these programs a more intuitive task. 

# Section 1: Importing Libraries
```python
import pygame
import sys
import time
import random

```
#### Description: This section imports necessary Python libraries for the game:

pygame:  A library for creating 2D games.
sys: Provides functions and variables to interact with the Python runtime environment.
time: Used for time-related operations.
random: Allows you to generate random numbers.
# Section 2: Difficulty Settings
```python
difficulty = 25
```
#### Description: This variable sets the difficulty level of the game. In this case, it's set to medium (25).

# Section 3: Window Size
```python
frame_size_x = 720
frame_size_y = 480
```
#### Description: These variables define the size of the game window with a width of 720 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
# Section 4: Error Checking
```python
check_errors = pygame.init()
if check_errors[1] > 0:
    print(f'[!] Had {check_errors[1]} errors when initializing the game, exiting...')
    sys.exit(-1)
else:
    print('[+] Game successfully initialized')
```
#### Description: Here, the code checks for any errors during the initialization of the pygame library. If errors are found, it prints an error message and exits the game. Otherwise, it prints a success message.
# Section 5: Initialize Game Window
```python
pygame.display.set_caption('Snake Eater')
game_window = pygame.display.set_mode((frame_size_x, frame_size_y))
```
#### Description: This code sets the game window's title to "Snake Eater" and initializes the game window with the specified size.
# Section 6: Define Colors
```python
black = pygame.Color(0, 0, 0)
white = pygame.Color(255, 255, 255)
red = pygame.Color(255, 0, 0)
green = pygame.Color(0, 255, 0)
blue = pygame.Color(0, 0, 255)
```
#### Description: These variables define colors that will be used in the game. They are represented as RGB values.
# Section 7: FPS (Frames Per Second) Controller
```python
fps_controller = pygame.time.Clock()
```
Description: This line creates an object to control the frame rate of the game.
# Section 8: Game Variables
```python
# Initialize snake position, body, and food
# Set initial direction, change direction, and initialize score
```
#### Description: This section initializes various game variables, including the snake's position and body, the food's position, the snake's direction, the direction the player intends to change to, and the score.
# Section 9: Game Over Function
```python
def game_over():
    # ...
```
#### Description: This function displays a game over message, waits for a few seconds, and then quits the game.
# Section 10: Score Display Function
```python
def show_score(choice, color, font, size):
    # ...
```
#### Description: This function displays the player's score on the screen.

# Section 11: Main Game Logic (Game Loop)
```python
while True:
    # Handle events, such as key presses or quitting the game
    # Update snake's direction and position
    # Check for collisions with food, boundaries, or itself
    # Draw the game elements
    # Update the display and control the frame rate
```
#### Description: This is the main game loop that continuously runs while the game is active. It handles various aspects of the game, such as user input, updating the snake's position, checking for collisions, drawing game elements, and controlling the frame rate.

## Conclusion

In this journey of creating a Snake game with pygame, we've explored the exciting world of game development. We started with importing libraries, defining game variables, and setting up the game window. As we delved deeper, we tackled challenges like handling user input, collision detection, and rendering graphics.

Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey. Stay tuned for more game development adventures and tech tutorials!
